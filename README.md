# Research Track 1 - Assignements

The two forlders here contain cover the assignments due for the Research Track I course 


The ROS nodes here contained allow for controlling an holonomic robot
by computing the velocity needed to drive it towards a target position,
here defined as a simple couple of random values between (-6.0, 6.0).
All nodes and custom services are contained in the package **holo_control**,
 along with their documentation.
